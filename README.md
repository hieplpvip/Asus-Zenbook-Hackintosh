Clover hotpatches and tools for the Asus Zenbook laptop on macOS 10.13.6+

## Supported models

- UX310 (KabyLake)
- UX330 (KabyLake) (not tested)
- UX330 (KabyLake-R)
- UX410 (KabyLake)
- UX430 (KabyLake)
- UX430 (KabyLake-R)

To add support for your laptop, please provide full specs and original ACPI files from Clover. Recent models (KabyLake, KabyLake-R) are preferred.

## What's working now

- Trackpad has some minor bugs (random cursor jumping, etc.), but gestures are great
- Wifi/Bluetooth: replace with DW1560. Stock Intel card will never work
- Audio not working 100% on UX430 KabyLake-R
- Everything else works well

## Instruction

- Basic instruction is available on the [wiki](https://github.com/hieplpvip/ASUS-ZENBOOK-HACKINTOSH/wiki).
