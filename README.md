Run macOS on Asus Zenbook with OpenCore

#### Supported models

- UX310 (Kaby Lake)
- UX330 (Kaby Lake)
- UX330 (Kaby Lake-R)
- UX410 (Kaby Lake)
- UX430 (Kaby Lake)
- UX430 (Kaby Lake-R)

I can not test support for all models as I only have UX410 (Kaby Lake). Please open issues (and possibly pull requests!) if it does not work for you.

#### What's working

- Trackpad sometimes stops working for a few minutes.
- Intel Wifi card needs to be replaced. I suggest [this one](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000631796433.html).
- Audio doesn't work perfectly on some models.
- Everything else works well.
